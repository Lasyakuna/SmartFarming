The traditional agricultural practices in India are increasingly challenged by the
unpredictable impacts of climate change, with erratic weather patterns and fluctuating soil
conditions disrupting crop cycles, especially during the winter crop season (Rabi).

Farmers face difficulties in planning and managing crops due to sudden weather
changes, unseasonal rainfall, and extended drought periods, which threaten food security
and agricultural livelihoods.

This project proposes a data analytics system to address these challenges by
leveraging extensive agricultural data and advanced machine learning algorithms. By
uncovering hidden patterns and providing actionable insights, the system aims to help
farmers make informed decisions on crop selection, irrigation, and pest management.

Integrating real-time weather data and historical climate trends, the system
enhances predictive capabilities, promoting proactive and sustainable agricultural
practices that improve resilience and productivity in the face of climate uncertainties
